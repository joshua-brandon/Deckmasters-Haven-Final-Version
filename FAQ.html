<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>

<h2>How long does it for orders to ship?</h2>
It usually takes around 2-5 buisness days once the order is completed.

<h2>Can I cancel my order?</h2>
Due to the proxies being made to order, we cannot cancel them once we have started. As long as you reach out to us quickly once the order is placed, we may be able to cancel it.

<h2>Are proxies fair to use?</h2>
Proxies are not tournament legal, but they are custom versions of real cards. They are fair to play in friendly matches for that reason.

<h2>Are there restrictions on the art for the cards?</h2>
We will not print any proxies with art that would be considered NSFW. This includes nudity and excessive gore.

<h2>Do you do double sided cards?</h2>
Not yet, but maybe we will in the future. For now, it is just single sided cards.
